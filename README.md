# Dual-Axis Solar Tracker
The "Dual-Axis Solar Tracker" uses 4 LDRs to sense the difference in the light intensity from four directions. It then processes the signals in the microcontroller - Arduino Uno. Finally, 2 servos rotate the attached Solar Panel in two different axes, horizontal and vertical. This way, the Solar Panel can face the direction of maximum light intensity, thereby increasing the productivity.
